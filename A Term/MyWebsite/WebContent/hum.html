	<p>Humanities at Mass Academy is taught by Mr. Ludt. So far, we've
		written, rehearsed, and performed skits based on Henry David Thoreau's
		Walden.</p>
	<p>
		We have also read love poems in <a href="PDFs/deirelmedina.pdf">Deir
			El-Medina</a>, a slave village in ancient Egypt. After we finished with
		Egypt, we moved on to Greece and read the <a
			href="PDFs/GreekDramaEssay.pdf">Iliad and Women of Troy</a>.
	</p>
	<p>In January, Mass Academy held its annual Day of Diversity. Every
		student gave a presentation about his or her family's cultural
		background and brought in an authentic food dish from his or her
		culture. I spoke about my family's journey from Germany to Israel
		during World War II and how my father moved to America when I was
		young.</p>
	<p>We read Shakespeare's Richard III, and William Wordsworth's
		poetry. We finished the year with early American writers, such as
		Edgar Allen Poe and Stephen Crane.</p>
