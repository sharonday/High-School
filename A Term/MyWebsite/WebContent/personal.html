	<h1>MY NAME IS...</h1>
	<div class=p>
		<p>
			Hi! My name is Daya Sharon and I am currently a junior at the <a
				href="http://www.massacademy.org/">Massachusetts Academy of Math
				and Science (also known as Mass Academy).</a> <br>Mass Academy is a
			math and science based high school for juniors and seniors. Before
			Mass Academy, I went to <a href="http://whs.westboroughk12.org/">Westborough
				High School.</a>

			My hobbies include swimming, rereading Harry Potter, and creating
			things.<br> I used to swim competitively but am currently taking
			a break to adjust to the more intense school environment of Mass
			Academy.

		<p>I was born in Jerusalem, Israel in November 1999. My family
			consists of my mom, my dad, me, and my two younger sisters. We have
			an almost five-year-old cat named Gingy. Gingy is the Hebrew word for
			ginger and my cat is definitely a red-head.</p>

			This past summer, I went to Israel with a leadership program from my
			camp. We traveled the country up and down. Those long bus rides made
			for great naps. Part of the program was coming back to camp for two
			weeks after five weeks in Israel. At camp, we were considered "CITs",
			or counselors-in-training. We learned how to be counselors and we had
			lots of fun throughout the entire time. Here's a picture of me at the
			top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masada">Masada.</a>,
			watching the sunrise.

		<p>For my community service junior year, I was an assistant
			teacher at Beth Tikvah Synagogue Religious School. I helped teach
			Hebrew language, reading and writing, to first and second grade
			students.</p>
		<p>I was also a part of the E-NABLE group at Mass Academy. We 3D
			printed prosthetic hands for people in need. The process included
			stringing hands together and using hot glue, screws, and velcro.</p>
