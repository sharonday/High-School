	<p>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) at Mass
		Academy is taught by Ms. Curran and Ms. Johnson. In STEM, we work on
		our STEM fair projects. My project is an engineering-based project
		centered around creating swimming goggles with proximity sensors
		attached to warn a swimmer of an upcoming wall.</p>
	<p>
		In December, we had a practice science fair to prepare us for our Mass
		Academy STEM Fair in February. Here's what was on my poster in <a
			href="PDFs/board.pdf">December</a>! We also wrote a <a
			href="PDFs/LiteratureReview.pdf">Literature Review</a> to sum up all
		of our research.
	</p>
	<p>Many swimmers have poor concentration, or poor eyesight, and
		ultimately obtain injuries by crashing into the wall of the pool.
		Radiofrequency identification (RFIDs), the same technology used in
		identification cards for business places and schools, was used to
		provide the wall sensing technology. The goal of this project was to
		engineer a wearable device that alerts a swimmer as he or she
		approaches a wall. A test was conducted to find the range of the RFID.
		The same test was then conducted in water to confirm that the device
		would function in a pool. The device created serves as a model for a
		crash-prevention device for swimmers. However, the range of the RFID
		used in this project was only one to four centimeters. The model could
		be modified for use with a longer-ranged RFID. Ranges of around four
		meters suffice to create a functional device capable of providing
		information when the swimmer is far enough from the wall to comprehend
		the visual cues from the device.</p>
