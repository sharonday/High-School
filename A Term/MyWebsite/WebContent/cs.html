	<p>Computer Science at Mass Academy is taught by Mrs. Taricco. So
		far, we've learned how to build a website using HTML and CSS.</p>
	<p>
		One of the programs I have written is a drawing program called <a
			href="PDFs/randomcircles.pdf">Random Circles</a>. It draws a random
		number of circles with random diameters in random locations on the
		screen using random colors and random transparencies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another program I have written is the <a href="PDFs/magicsquare.pdf">Magic
			Square</a>. The program creates an nXn square using numbers 1-n, where
		all of the rows and columns add up to the same sum, and no number is
		used twice.
	</p>
	<p>During the second half of the year, we work on a project called
		Apps for Good. We developed apps to help solve a problem in the
		community. My group decided to create an app to help people from
		overspending on groceries. The main feature of our app is that it is
		able to take any grocery list and find an alternative list of similar
		items. This alternative list will be either healthier, or less
		expensive, than the original list, based on whether the user in in
		"Price Mode" or "Health Mode". We did a lot of research to see if
		there was an app out there that did what we wanted to try to
		accomplish. Fortunately for our project, it seemed that our idea was
		unique. We had a bit of trouble retrieving the price information for
		the grocery items, but we figured out a way to retrieve the
		information from Stop & Shop's Peapod website. We ended up with a
		great app called "getFood();". You can see our poster below!</p>
